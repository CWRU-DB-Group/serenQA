  <h3>Instructions for Expertise Evaluators</h3>

  <h4>How the Questions are Organized</h4>
  The questions are divided into <b>5 batches</b> based on drug categories.
  You can refer to <a href="batches.json">batch.json</a> to see the categories for each batch.
  Each question’s category is labeled as <span style="color: gray;">[Category -  Category:Subcategory]</span> following the text question.

  <h4>How the LLM Ranking are Generated</h4>
  The <b>LLM ranking</b> is generated by evaluating the serendipity of each answer within a question using GPT-4O, GPT-4O-mini, and
  Claude-3.5-Sonnet, following a specific <a href="prompt.txt">prompt</a>.
  Rankings are based on the mean score across these models.
  The first in line is the most serendipity answer according to the models.

  <h4>Your Role</h4>
  Please complete your evaluation following these steps: <br>
  1. <b><u>Review the Question and Rankings</u></b>: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· Select at least <b>2 batches</b> that align with your interest or expertise to evaluate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· Carefully review the <b>LLM rankings</b> for each question in your selected batch.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· Assess whether you agree with the provided order.<br>
  2. <b><u>Provide Your Input</u></b>: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· If you agree with the ranking, select <b>Yes</b>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· If you disagree, select <b>No</b> and provide your own ranking based on your expertise.<br>
  3. <b><u>Format for Your Ranking</u></b>: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· Use the numbers corresponding to the answers in the LLM ranking. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· Separate the numbers with commas (e.g., <b>2, 1, 3</b> for Answer (2) > Answer (1) > Answer (3)). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· If you are not confident in ranking all answers, you may rank only a subset.<br>
  4. <b><u>Confidence Rating</u></b>: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· For each batch, rate your confidence (1–5) in the responses, where <b>1</b> indicates the lowest confidence and <b>5</b> the highest.
